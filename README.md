# Learning Evaluation Metrics Calculation

In this project, we will calculate key metrics for evaluating data classification models, such as accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F-score. To implement these functions, you will use the corresponding methods and formulas (see Table 1).

To compute these metrics, you will need to choose a confusion matrix as the base for the calculations. The selection of this matrix can be arbitrary, as the goal is to understand how each metric functions.

Table 1: Overview of Metrics Used to Evaluate Classification Methods

    VP: True Positives
    FN: False Negatives
    FP: False Positives
    VN: True Negatives
    P: Precision
    S: Sensitivity
    N: Total number of elements
